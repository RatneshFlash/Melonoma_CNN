## General Information
To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma.
Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early.
It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate
images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the
potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## Conclusions
Using CNN method we can come up with model which can predict Melonoma cancer.
The current model is not accurate but by Transfer learning we can boost performance
of this model.
